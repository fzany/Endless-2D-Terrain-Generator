Endless - 2D Terrain Generator allows you to rapidly create rule-based terrain and prefab placement to get your infinite runner into the app store in no time.

I no longer have time to support the package, so I decided to make it a free download - modify it however you like. Enjoy!

Features:
o No coding required! All terrain generation is based off of rules you enter in the editor.
o Create hills! No more boring flat terrain - dynamically generated meshes can create hills and valleys in your 2d runner.
o Fully commented C# code.
o Mobile ready. Terrain is only generated when needed and is destroyed when no longer on the screen. This keeps performance smooth on mobile devices (tested on Android HTC EVO 3D)

1.2 Changes
o Fix terrain flickering bug in iOS.
o Fix editor warning in Unity 4.3

1.1 Changes
o Limit prefab placement by min and max distance traveled
o Limit prefab placement based on the current terrain rule
